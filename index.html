        <h3>How it all started</h3>
        <span class="text"
          >Working as a technical recruiter and daily speaking with software
          engineers got me interested into learning about coding. After I
          finished the CS50 course taught by David Malan it all started to make
          sense. I learned about algorithams, data structures, web development,
          security and how to solve problems efficiently. Most important thing
          that taught me was that you don’t need to be good at maths or to have
          CS degree to learn how to code. It’s all about how hard you work, how
          much practice and perseverance. Basically continuously learning.</span

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <span class="text"
          >My goal is to become a software engineer that writes code which has a
          social impact. I've read a lot about the program that Founders and
          Coders offers. It looks like a great developer community that not only
          provides a life-changing educational experience but is also surrounded
          by inspiring people that put together a non-profit organization to
          help stundets from all background to break into tech. On my spare time
          I've sent a lot of time watching coding tutorials, solving coding
          challenges on codewars, completing programming courses on online
          platforms but the main thing missing is the peer-led learning. Having
          the chance to closely collaborate with other students,
          pair-programming, brainstorming, saying yes to ideas that maybe I
          didn't think about it is something that excites me.

          This is a standout course and one of the best online learning experiences I've had. It introduces you to
          various subjects, including web development, both front and back-end.
          Professor Malan is animated, enthusiastic, and is very passionate
          about teaching computer science and programming.

          On this platform I've completed two courses: Learn JavaScript and
          Learn Phyton. These were interactive online courses, well structured.
          Each lesson was split in learning about syntax, documnetation, project
          work and final quiz.

          I've used udemy to learn more about web programming. Both courses I
          took there were mainly around JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I found it
          useful following along with the teachers and creating projects from
          scratch.

          One year ago, I decided to learn more about coding. This platform was
          the perfect place to learn for free how HTML and CSS work. Afer a few months I
          received two certificates: Responsive Web Design and JavaScript
          Algorithams and Data Structures.
